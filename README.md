## Abstract

A portable cardiac monitoring system is crucial in daily life due to the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and consistent monitoring of cardiac health can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications such as heart attacks or strokes. Traditional hospital-based monitoring systems are often inaccessible in remote or underprivileged areas and inconvenient for continuous, long-term use. A portable system bridges this gap by offering real-time tracking of vital parameters like ECG, heart rate, and oxygen levels, empowering individuals to monitor their health from the comfort of their homes. This not only enhances patient outcomes through timely intervention but also reduces the burden on healthcare facilities. This project presents the design and implementation of a portable cardiac monitoring system using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. The system integrates an AD8232 ECG sensor, MAX30102 Heart-Rate/Spo2 sensor to monitor and display real-time ECG signals, Heart-Rate/Oxygen Level on an OLED display. This project report discusses the hardware configuration, software development, and challenges encountered, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for real-time cardiac monitoring. <br/>

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for millions of deaths each year. Early diagnosis and continuous monitoring are key to improving patient outcomes, reducing the risk of severe events such as heart attacks, strokes, and sudden cardiac arrests. However, current cardiac monitoring solutions, such as hospital-based equipment, are often expensive, bulky, and require specialized medical facilities and personnel. Furthermore, they are not easily accessible in rural or underserved areas where healthcare infrastructure may be limited. The lack of affordable, portable, and easy-to-use cardiac monitoring systems exacerbates this challenge, preventing individuals from effectively managing their heart health in everyday life. As a result, there is a growing need for an affordable, efficient, and portable solution that enables continuous, real-time monitoring of vital cardiac parameters outside of traditional medical settings. 

### Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a **Portable Cardiac Monitoring System** that can continuously monitor and display vital cardiac parameters, specifically the **ECG signals**, **heart rate**, and **SpO2 levels**, in real time. By integrating affordable, compact, and widely available components such as the **STM32F103C8 microcontroller**, **MAX30102 sensor**, and **AD8232 ECG module**, this system offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for personal health monitoring. The system will provide an intuitive user interface, displaying ECG graphs and vital signs on a mobile application, allowing individuals to track their cardiac health without the need for specialized medical equipment. 

### Scope
This portable cardiac monitoring system is designed primarily for **home-based health monitoring** and **fitness tracking**, making it suitable for individuals looking to track their cardiovascular health in a non-clinical environment. It can be used by people with pre-existing heart conditions, fitness enthusiasts, or individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease, helping them stay proactive about their health. The system provides an accessible middle ground between **clinical-grade devices**, which are often costly and complex, and basic **consumer-grade health gadgets**, which may lack the necessary diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, this system offers a more affordable, real-time, and continuous solution for heart health management, addressing the limitations of traditional systems and expanding access to quality cardiac care.
