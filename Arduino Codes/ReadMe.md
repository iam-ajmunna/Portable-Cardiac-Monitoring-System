<h1> IDE Choosing: </h1>
<div>I have Used ArduinoIDE. If you are using ArmKeil, STM32CubeIDE, this code won't work. You need different codes for different environments. Comparatively, ArduinoIDE has easy code requirements. Moreover, You need to Add Libraries for the Sensors and OLED Display, for which ArmKeil, STM32CubeIDE is not user-friendly in terms of adding libraries.</div>
<h1> Suggestion on Code </h1>
<div>Here, you can see I have separate codes for separate functionality. The right way to code is to combine all three codes together and put some conditional functions so that two sensors can be performed using a button input. For example, a single tap is used for heart rate measurement, and a double tap is used for ECG diagrams. </div>
<div>Now, The Reason for my separate code for separate functions is for the complexity of library and code management and mainly for the short time period to complete the project.</div>
<h1>You Should Know</h1>
<div> These Codes are not precise, and this project is not yet applicable for medical purposes. But if you have the ambition, you can make it eligible for medical purposes ðŸ˜‰.</div>
<h2>BEST OF LUCK</h2>
