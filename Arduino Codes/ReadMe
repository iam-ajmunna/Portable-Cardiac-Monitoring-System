<h1> IDE Chosing: </h1>
<div>I have Used ArduinoIDE. If you are using ArmKeil,STM32CubeIDE this code won't work. You need different codes for different environment. Comparitively ArduinoIDE has easy code requirement. Moreover, You need to Add Libraries for the Sensors and OLED Display for which ArmKeil, STM32CubeIDE is not user-friendly in terms of adding libraries.</div>
<h1> Suggestion on Code </h1>
